# roam_JIRA_export

A chrome extension that exports the current page to JIRA text format and copies it to the clipboard. Currently supports:

* ```
    code blocks
  ``` 
* :white_check_mark: TODO entries
* `inline` code

To use, clone the repository and open the chrome "extensions" window. Enable developer mode, click "load unpacked extension" and locate the cloned repo.

After installation, the "..." menu in the upper-right of Roam will have a new "Export to JIRA" option.
